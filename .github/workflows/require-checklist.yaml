# According to github, the "actor" for dependabot is dependabot[bot]:
# https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot/automating-dependabot-with-github-actions#responding-to-events
# This should allow us to NOT require checklist from that bot anymore.
# Since we're considering Renovate bot instead, we also exclude it from that
# workflow, using https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/discussions/13704 as
# github.actor value.
