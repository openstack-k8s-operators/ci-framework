# By default, the OSP VMs will run using a default image.
# In upstream, it's usually latest centos-stream-9
# For downstream, it's usually rhel-9.4 image, depending on
# the job configuration.
#
# Since OSP infra must use an older RHEL image, you can override it
# by setting "osp_base_img_url" to point to the downstream QCOW2 image,
# and "osp_base_img_sha256" holding the SHA256SUM of the image.
#
# We can't automatically discover the image, the role/module sets the
# value globally, and it would clash with the needs for RHOSO images.

# Use anchor to avoid repetitions. This block is common to all of OSP nodes.
