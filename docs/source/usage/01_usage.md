```{admonition} Words of caution
:class: danger
If you want to output the content in another location than `~/ci-framework-data`
(namely set the `cifmw_basedir` to some other location), you will have to update
the `ansible.cfg`, updating the value of `roles_path` so that it includes
this new location.

We cannot do this change runtime unfortunately.
```

## Role level parameters

Please refer to the README located within the various roles.

## Provided playbooks and scenarios

The provided playbooks and scenarios allow to deploy a full stack with
various options. Please refer to the provided examples and roles if you
need to know more.

## Hooks

The framework is able to leverage hooks located in various locations. Using
proper parameter name, you may run arbitrary playbook or load custom CRDs at
specific points in the standard run.

Allowed parameter names are:

- `pre_infra`: before bootstrapping the infrastructure
- `post_infra`: after bootstrapping the infrastructure
- `pre_package_build`: before building packages against sources
- `post_package_build`: after building packages against sources
- `pre_container_build`: before building container images
- `post_container_build`: after building container images
- `pre_deploy`: before deploying EDPM
- `post_deploy`: after deploying EDPM
- `post_ctlplane_deploy`: after Control Plane deployment
- `pre_tests`: before running tests
- `post_tests`: after running tests
- `pre_admin_setup`: before admin setup
- `post_admin_setup`: before admin setup
- `pre_reporting`: before running reporting
- `post_reporting`: after running reporting

Since steps may be skipped, we must ensure proper post/pre exists for specific
steps.

In order to provide a hook, please pass the following as an environment file:

```{code-block} YAML
:caption: custom/my-hook.yml
:linenos:
pre_infra:
    - name: My glorious hook name
      type: playbook
      source: foo.yml
    - name: My glorious CRD
      type: crd
      host: https://my.openshift.cluster
      username: foo
      password: bar
      wait_condition:
        type: pod
      source: /path/to/my/glorious.crd
```

In the above example, the `foo.yml` is located in
[hooks/playbooks](https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/ci-framework/tree/main/hooks/playbooks) while
`glorious.crd` is located in some external path.

Also, the list order is important: the hook will first load the playbook,
then the CRD.

Note that you really should avoid pointing to external resources, in order to
ensure everything is available for job reproducer.

## Ansible tags

In order to allow user to run only a subset of tasks while still consuming the
entry playbook, the Framework exposes tags one may leverage with either `--tags`
or `--skip-tags`:

- `bootstrap`: Run all of the package installation tasks as well as the potential system configuration depending on the options you set.
- `packages`: Run all package installation tasks associated to the options you set.
- `bootstrap_layout`: Run the [reproducer](../reproducers/01-considerations.md) bootstrap steps only.
- `bootstrap_libvirt`: Run the [reproducer](../reproducers/01-considerations.md) libvirt bootstrap only.
- `bootstrap_repositories`: Run the [reproducer](../reproducers/01-considerations.md) repositories bootstrap steps only.
- `infra`: Denotes tasks to prepare host virtualization and Openshift Container Platform when deploy-edpm.yml playbook is run.
- `build-packages`: Denotes tasks to call the role [pkg_build](../roles/pkg_build.md) when deploy-edpm.yml playbook is run.
- `build-containers`: Denotes tasks to call the role [build_containers](../roles/build_containers.md) when deploy-edpm.yml playbook is run.
- `build-operators`: Denotes tasks to call the role [operator_build](../roles/operator_build.md) when deploy-edpm.yml playbook is run.
- `control-plane`: Deploys the control-plane on OpenShift by creating `OpenStackControlPlane` CRs when deploy-edpm.yml playbook is run.
- `edpm`: Deploys the data-plane (External Data Plane Management) on RHEL nodes by creating `OpenStackDataPlane` CRs when deploy-edpm.yml playbook is run.
- `admin-setup`: Denotes tasks to call the role [os_net_setup](../roles/os_net_setup.md) when deploy-edpm.yml playbook is run.
- `run-tests`: Denotes tasks to call the roles [tempest](../roles/tempest.md) and/or [tobiko](../roles/tobiko.md) when deploy-edpm.yml playbook is run.
- `logs`: Denotes tasks which generate artifacts via the role [artifacts](../roles/artifacts.md) and when collect logs when deploy-edpm.yml playbook is run.

For instance, if you want to bootstrap a hypervisor, and reuse it over and
over, you'll run the following commands:

```Bash
[controller-0]$ ansible-playbook deploy-edpm.yml \
    -K --tags bootstrap,packages \
    [-e @scenarios/centos-9/some-environment -e <...>]
$
[controller-0]$ ansible-playbook deploy-edpm.yml \
    -K --skip-tags bootstrap,packages \
    [-e @scenarios/centos-9/some-environment -e <...>]
```

Running the command twice, with `--tags` and `--skip-tags` as only difference,
will ensure your environment has the needed directories, packages and
configurations with the first run, while skip all of those tasks in the
following runs. That way, you will save time and resources.

If you've already deployed OpenStack but it failed
during [os_net_setup](../roles/os_net_setup.md) and you've taken steps
to correct the problem and want to test if they resolved the issue,
then use:

```Bash
[controller-0]$ ansible-playbook deploy-edpm.yml -K --tags admin-setup
```

More tags may show up according to the needs.
