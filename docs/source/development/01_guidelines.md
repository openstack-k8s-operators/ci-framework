# Contribution guidelines

## Ansible best practices
We try hard to follow [Ansible Best Practices](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/tips_tricks/index.html).

### Include vs Import
Usually, we should rely on `ansible.builtin.import_(tasks|role)` instead of
`ansible.builtin.include_(tasks|role)`.

While both are mostly doing the same, the time and support is different.
#### Include
The `include_*` directives allow to load content dynamically. This is usually
mandatory when we want to `loop` on items, and include multiple time the same
tasks or role. The inclusion is done mostly runtime, and makes some usages a
bit more complicated.

For instance, `tags` aren't passed along, unless we use `apply` keyword.

The `include_*` directives may also have an impact on performances.

#### Import
The `import_*` directives allow to load content statically. It's usually
"compiled" internally when the play environment is built, meaning we may get
small performances improvements. They fully support `tags` so that we may
get a more convenient way to filter tasks in the play.

~~~{admonition} What to use then?
:class: tip
A simple rule of thumb: if I intend to run the tasks/role multiple time
over the same play, I'll use `include_*` module. For the rest, I'll use
`import_*`.

## Testing
### Ansible role
Please take the time to ensure [molecule tests](./02_molecule.md) are present
and cover as many corner cases as possible.

### Ansible custom plugins
Please take the time to consider how to test your custom plugins. You may
either rely on [molecule](./02_molecule.md) or, maybe,
[ansible-test](https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/ci-framework/tree/main/ci_framework/tests/integration).
