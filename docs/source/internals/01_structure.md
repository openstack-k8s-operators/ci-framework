# Structure

## Roles, Playbooks & Plugins

We can find them here: https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/ci-framework/tree/main/ci_framework

Each role, playbook and plugin has README.md with the related documentation.

Some roles uses the [install_yamls](https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/install_yamls) project. Althought is not part directly of the CI Framework project it's good to keep on mind. We could need to do changes there.

We will also find in the root of the project the [deploy-edpm.yml](https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/ci-framework/blob/main/deploy-edpm.yml) file that import all the playbooks needed to setup everything - these playbooks import all the roles that are part of the framework -, it means that it will setup a CRC environment with EDPM VMs. We have more information in [Using the framework](https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/ci-framework#using-the-framework).

To cleanup everything [cleanup-edpm.yml](https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/ci-framework/blob/main/cleanup-edpm.yml).

## Scripts

In the [scripts](https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/ci-framework/tree/main/scripts) folder of the CI Framework project we can see different scripts that are being used for the [Makefile](https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/ci-framework/blob/main/Makefile) file.
