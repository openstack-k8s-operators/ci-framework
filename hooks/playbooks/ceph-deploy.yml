    # For the records, this role is generated in the 01-bootstrap.yml playbook
    # by leveraging the install_yamls role and related modules, especially
    # the generate_make_tasks.
    # And we can pass down the cifmw_make_ceph_environment set in the
    # environment of the main play. If we don't have anything for that param,
    # let's default to an empty hash.
