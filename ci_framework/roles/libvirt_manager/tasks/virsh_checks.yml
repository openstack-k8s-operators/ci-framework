# stabilize libvirt accesses
# We hit a fair amount of failures with the libvirt sockets over the
# past iteration. After many tests, it seems that removing the timeout
# of the virtproxyd service and ensuring it's enabled and started
# corrects this issue. With this hack, we could successfully deploy the
# whole VA-1 layout without any issue.
