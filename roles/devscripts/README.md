# devscripts

This role is a wrapper around the set of scripts provided by metal3 CI team
that automates deploying of OpenShift Container Platform on baremetal like
libvirt/kvm virtual machines.

## Privilege escalation

Yes, requires privilege escalation to install dependant packages on the system. Along with performing
network configuration, repository setup and libvirt networks.

## Exposed tags

* `devscripts_prepare`: Selects tasks related to "preparing the host" and building the various
needed files.
* `devscripts_deploy`: Overlaps with the previous tag, and adds the actual deployment of devscripts
managed services.
* `devscripts_post`: Only runs the post-installation tasks.

## Parameters

* `cifmw_devscripts_artifacts_dir` (str) path to the directory to store the role artifacts.
* `cifmw_devscripts_config_overrides` (dict) key/value pairs to be used for overriding the default
  configuration. Refer [section](#supported-keys-in-cifmw_devscripts_config_overrides) for more information.
* `cifmw_devscripts_dry_run` (bool) If enabled, the workflow is evaluated.
* `cifmw_devscripts_make_target` (str) Optional, the target to be used with dev-scripts.
* `cifmw_devscripts_ocp_version` (str) The version of OpenShift to be deployed.
* `cifmw_devscripts_osp_compute_nodes` (list) A list of nodes which has key/value pairs
  containing details about OpenStack compute nodes. Refer
  [section](#supported-keys-in-cifmw_devscripts_osp_compute_nodes) for more information.
* `cifmw_devscripts_src_dir` (str) The parent folder of dev-scripts repository.
* `cifmw_devscripts_use_layers` (bool) Toggle overlay support. Specifically, this boolean will instruct the role to
  shutdown the whole OCP cluster, dump the XML, undefine the nodes, and prevents running the "post" tasks. Defaults to `false`.
* `cifmw_devscripts_remove_default_net` (bool) Remove the default virtual network. Defaults to `false`.

### Secrets management

This role calls the [manage_secrets](./manage_secrets.md) role. It allows to copy or create
the needed secrets.

#### pull-secret

You **must** provide either `cifmw_manage_secrets_pullsecret_file` OR
`cifmw_manage_secrets_pullsecret_content`.

If you provide neither, or both, it will fail.

#### CI Token

You **must** provide either `cifmw_manage_secrets_citoken_file` OR
`cifmw_manage_secrets_citoken_content`.

If you provide neither, or both, it will fail.
