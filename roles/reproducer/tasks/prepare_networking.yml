# Since ci_nmstate relies on the inventory_hostname to find its
# configuration, we have to bend ansible a bit:
# it does NOT want to get any jinja2 in a dict *key*, meaning we
# can't provide a nice parameter from within the networking-definition.yml
# environment file using the `cifmw_target_host`.
# We have, instead, to build the structure as a plain string, where it gets
# the proper interpretation, and convert that string into YAML.
# Of course, if anyone provides their own config, we won't override it.
# As a matter of fact, `set_fact` doesn't override user-provided parameters
# anyway.
