## Examples
Usually we'll import the role as-is at the very start of the playbook, and
import the tasks from `packages.yml` at the very end:
```YAML
---
- hosts: all
  gather_facts: false
  roles:
    - artifacts
    - (some other roles)
  tasks:
    - name: Do some other tasks
      block:
        - name: Tasks 1
          ansible.builtin.file:
            path: /tmp/foo
            state: present
        - (some other tasks)
      always:
        - name: Gather install packages
          ansible.builtin.import_role:
            name: artifacts
            tasks_from: packages.yml
```
